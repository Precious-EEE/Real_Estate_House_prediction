## 🏠 Project Overview – Real Estate House Price Prediction Web App

This project is a machine learning-powered **real estate price prediction app** that estimates the selling price of a house based on various features like location, number of rooms, square footage, and more. The app was built to demonstrate how predictive analytics can be applied in real estate decision-making using modern ML tools and deployed as a web-based application.

It combines data preprocessing, model training, and a clean user interface into one streamlined solution. Users can input house features and instantly receive a predicted price through an interactive web interface.
